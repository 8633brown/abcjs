# Javascript library for rendering standard music notation in a browser.

This library makes it easy to incorporate **sheet music** into your **websites**. You can also turn visible **ABC** text into sheet music on websites that you don't own using a greasemonkey script, or change your own website that contains ABC text with no other changes than the addition of one javascript file. You can also generate **MIDI files** or play them directly in your browser.

BETA NOTE:
The documentation has not been updated for the beta version. It is set for the latest released version.

Full documentation is here: [abcjs documentation](https://paulrosen.github.io/abcjs/)

## Coronavirus Notice

Like everyone else, my life is turned upside down since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and I have fallen behind on answering questions and otherwise working on this project.

But don't worry, this is still a high priority and I anticipate catching up before the end of April.

Thanks for your patience, and please stay safe, stay home, and wash your hands.
