# Javascript library for rendering standard music notation in a browser.

This library makes it easy to incorporate **sheet music** into your **websites**. You can also turn visible **ABC** text into sheet music on websites that you don't own using a greasemonkey script, or change your own website that contains ABC text with no other changes than the addition of one javascript file. You can also generate **MIDI files** or play them directly in your browser.

## NEAR TERM PLAN:
I hope to have the next beta around mid to late July. It will be mostly audio improvements, but there will likely be bugs fixes everywhere. 

If you have a particular issue that is impeding your usage of this library, please mention it in the issue.

Thanks, Paul

## BETA NOTE:
The documentation has only been partly updated for the beta version.

Full documentation is here: [abcjs documentation](https://paulrosen.github.io/abcjs/)

## Issues

Thanks so much for the bug reports and feature requests that are pouring into the issues. I appreciate you taking the time to help improve abcjs. This is not a full time project, though, so I can't promise a quick turn around on the issues. I am going to attempt to be caught up on responding once a week at least.

And I would love some help on this project, particularly with documentation at the moment, but many other things, too, as soon as I finish some refactoring. If you are so inclined, please get in touch.

## Supported by BrowserStack
If you aren't using the same browser and machine that I use, you can thank [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com/) for their support of this open-source project.
